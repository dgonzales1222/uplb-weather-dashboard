# UPLB Weather Data Dashboard

A relational database and public web dashboard for long-term weather observations from the
University of the Philippines Los Baños National Agromet Station (UPLB-NAS), Los Baños, Laguna.
The system supports a climate-change study centered on the heat index, incorporating multi-year
trend analysis and a short-term forecast.

This repository contains the work of a master's capstone project by Danilo III O. Gonzales,
MS in Green Data Science (Data Science in Agriculture, Food, Forest, and Environment),
Instituto Superior de Agronomia – Universidade de Lisboa (ISA–ULisboa).

## Live Preview

A static preview of the dashboard design is hosted on GitHub Pages:

> **Disclaimer.** GitHub Pages serves static files only, so this link shows how the dashboard is
> *meant to look* — it is **not the live application**, and its charts are placeholder mock-ups
> rather than figures computed from the database. Serving this design as a fully interactive public
> site would require a complete web stack (for example, a Django back end with a dedicated front
> end). For now, the interactive dashboard — real Open-Meteo data, live charts, and the heat-index
> forecast — is the **Dash application** in this repository: run it locally (see below) or deploy it
> to Render. The same UPLB design is implemented directly in that Dash app.

## Data Source

The intended data source is the observational record of the UPLB National Agromet Station.
As these records are still being requested, the system is currently developed against the
Open-Meteo Historical Weather API (ERA5 reanalysis) as a representative stand-in. The data
access layer is deliberately isolated so that station records can be substituted without
modifying the database, analysis, or dashboard components.

## Objectives

1. Design a relational database for station information, instruments, and weather observations.
2. Develop a web-based dashboard presenting general weather summaries and a climate-change
   analysis of heat-index trends, together with a short-term forecast.
3. Deploy the system online using free hosting suitable for academic use.

## Features

- A relational SQLite database covering stations, variables, and observations.
- A General Weather page providing latest readings (with a feels-like heat index), interactive
  time-series charts for temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, pressure, and wet-bulb
  temperature, and monthly and annual climatology summaries.
- A Climate Insights page presenting a multi-year heat-index trend with PAGASA danger bands, a
  calendar heatmap of the daily heat index, an annual count of days exceeding a 41 °C heat
  index, and a 7–14 day LSTM forecast (drawn as a Monte-Carlo trajectory) with backtest accuracy
  metrics (MAE, RMSE).
- A custom UPLB-branded interface — an "editorial" liquid-glass theme with light/dark mode, a
  feels-like danger gauge, and a campus-photo footer — built directly in Dash.
- A modular data layer enabling a transition from Open-Meteo data to UPLB-NAS records without
  changes to downstream components.

## Technology Stack

Python 3.12 or later, with pandas for data processing, SQLite for storage, Dash and Plotly
for the web interface, a PyTorch LSTM for the short-term heat-index forecast, and the
openmeteo-requests client for data retrieval. The interface is a custom UPLB-branded design
implemented with Dash components and CSS (Dash Bootstrap Components is used only for layout).

## Installation and Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgonzales1222/avcad-project-uplb-weather-dashboard.git
cd avcad-project-uplb-weather-dashboard

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m src.data.ingest         # retrieve data and build the database (first run only)
python -m src.dashapp.app         # Dash app at http://localhost:8050
```

## Deployment

The app deploys to [Render](https://render.com) (free tier) via `render.yaml`. The forecast is
**precomputed offline** (`python -m src.models.precompute` → `src/dashapp/forecast_precomputed.json`)
so the deployed server is **torch-free**: it installs the slim `requirements-render.txt`, rebuilds the
database at build time (`python -m src.data.ingest`), and runs
`gunicorn src.dashapp.app:server`. Re-run the precompute step whenever the data is refreshed.

## System Architecture

```
Open-Meteo API ──fetch──> data/raw/ ──clean──> SQLite (data/weather.db) ──> Dash application
  (sources.py)                       (clean.py / ingest.py)                  (src/dashapp/)
```

> **Note:** `data/` — both the raw downloads (`data/raw/`) and the SQLite database
> (`data/weather.db`) — is git-ignored and stored only on the local machine. It is never
> committed to the repository; run the ingestion steps to regenerate it locally.

All external data access is confined to `src/data/sources.py`, and the dashboard reads only
from the local database. Substituting the UPLB-NAS records therefore requires changes only to
that module and a re-run of the ingestion process.

> **Status (28/06/2026):** Phases 0–6 complete. The dashboard is built on **Dash/Plotly**
> (migrated from the originally planned Streamlit), and the short-term forecast uses a **PyTorch
> LSTM** (replacing the originally planned Prophet). Phase 7 is in progress: the UPLB-branded
> **editorial / liquid-glass interface** has been implemented, and the app is deployment-ready for
> **Render** (torch-free server via a precomputed forecast) — only the live deploy remains.
> Phase 8 (real UPLB-NAS records) is next.

## Data Attribution

Historical weather data are provided by Open-Meteo (ERA5 reanalysis) under its free,
non-commercial terms of use, and are to be replaced by records from the UPLB National Agromet
Station. The heat index is computed using the U.S. National Weather Service formula, and danger
classifications follow the categories defined by PAGASA.
